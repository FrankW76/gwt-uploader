<body>
This library provides a means to provide sophisticated file upload capabilities within a GWT application, including
support for tracking the status, progress, and speed of each upload.  It attempts to provide the file upload capabilities
first via HTML5 capabilities using the "XMLHttpRequest Level 2" type APIs if the browser can support them, and
if not reverts back to embedding the <a href="http://swfupload.org/">SWFUpload</a> Flash-based mechanism
to provide equivalent capabilities.  In either case, the API calls (and most notably the events) are identical
to the programmer, so once you've coded your application to use the "GWT Uploader" API and event callbacks the
upload logic should work identically independent of whether or not the browser supports the HTML5 mechanism.
The logical starting point is the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.client.Uploader} class,
which provides the primary GWT widget that can be used to create a GWT Uploader instance and add it to a GWT application.
<p/>
To use, first, add the jar file to your project, and include the library in the GWT xml
configuration file for your module:
<pre><code>
    &lt;inherits name="org.moxieapps.gwt.uploader.Uploader"/&gt;
</code></pre>
Then, the basic usage of the API is as follows:
<pre><code>
   Uploader uploader = new Uploader()
      .setUploadURL("http://www.widgetcorp.com/uploads.php")
      .setButtonText("Click Here <span class='redText'>Yeah</span>")
      .setButtonTextStyle(".redText { color: #FF0000; }")
      .setButtonWidth(100)
      .setButtonHeight(22)
      .setButtonCursor(Upload.Cursor.HAND);
   RootPanel.get().add(upload);
</code></pre>
<p/>
Please see the <a href="http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-uploader/">GWT Uploader</a> project page
for more details on how to use this library, and in particular the
<a href="http://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-uploader/showcase/">demonstration applications</a> which provide
a collection of code examples that show various usage patterns.
